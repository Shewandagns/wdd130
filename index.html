            Hello, my name is Shewandagn S. Woyesa, I am from Addis Ababa Ethiopia and programming student with keen interest in web development.
            I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day-Saints. I joined the church on March 11, 2011.
            Coming to the church has taught me a lot including how sabbath worship can affect my spiritual life. 
            Not only this, I have learned a lot from members and leaders of the church that lead me to serve a full-time mission.
            I have learned the importance of obedience and loving God's children regardless what circumstance they are in. 
            I love playing video games and watching movies, my favorite movies are mostly from the MCU, my favorite movie is Black Panther. 
            I would love to learn more and improve my ability to code and become familiar with rules and functions. 
            My goal this year is to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I hope and believe with the help of the Lord I will achieve it.
